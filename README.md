# spectrum-css
The goal is to support [Spectrum][spectrum-link] design language as a CSS implementation.  

This project is an example of how to merge Spectrum DNA generated data into a working set of CSS and web markup.  This is also the 'default reference' for creating Spectrum-styled UI elements for the web. The output of this project forms the source for styling other, more complex frameworks such as Torq, React-Spectrum, or CoralUI. 

The output from this project can be seen [on Jenkins](https://designcodestuff.ci.corp.adobe.com:12001/job/spectrum-css/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/docs/index.html).  Contibutors will need a local build, and it's recommended that downstream framework developers also create a local build for reference.  However, in a pinch, the Jenkins build should represent a stable view of what is available.

## Project Structure
The current setup of this project is to use Stylus to pre-process selectors.  We are refactoring to move away from the use of the `abstract-stylus` project to pull in mixins as a dependency.  Instead, this project will define the standard for selectors and markup.  Providing some ability to export support functions needed for legacy projects is TBD.

In this project, there are three sets of source files.  
- `src/elements/css`: contains the source for element CSS selectors, with related attribute/value pairs.
- `src/elements/html`: this is the 'default' markup (in [topdoc](topdoc-link) format) that aligns with the css generated by this project.  Documentation is generated using the metatdate stored here.
- `src/elements/constants`: **WIP** these source files provide constants from the Spectrum DNA project in the form of build generated output.  This allows DNA to be a dev-dependency only, keeping it from needing to be released as an open depenedency.

## Building
Currently, this is an npm script driven project.  The available build tasks are [defined in package.json](https://git.corp.adobe.com/Spectrum/spectrum-css/blob/master/package.json#L5-L21), which drive a mixture of steps from the `tasks/` folder, Spectrum DNA related tools, and common web stack tools.  

As a getting started TL;DR, you can do this:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

Your `dist/` folder should now have a local copy of the Spectrum-CSS docs and other goodies.
