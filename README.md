# spectrum-css

This is work in progress from the Adobe Design Frameworks team.  The goal is to support [Spectrum](spectrum.corp.adobe.com) consumption via web by providing a standard implementation that can be integrated into other libraries.

To open an issue, or request a feature, use our [JIRA project](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SPECTRUM).

Documentation will eventually be pushed to `gh-pages`, but we're not quite there yet.

For questions, or to discuss, join us on [Slack](adobespectrum.slack.com)!

Thanks - Adobe Design Frameworks
