# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone.

Star by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo, then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork:

```
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/spectrum-css.git
```

Set up a branch for your feature or bug fix, push it to your fork, and set up a remote for the upstream repo:

```
git checkout -b my-awesome-new-feature
git push -u origin my-awesome-new-feature
git remote add upstream git@git.corp.adobe.com:Spectrum/spectrum-css.git
```

Set up the `@spectrum` npm namespace in your `.npmrc`

```
echo "@spectrum:registry=https://artifactory.corp.adobe.com:443/artifactory/api/npm/npm-spectrum-release/" >> ~/.npmrc;
echo "@a4u:registry=https://artifactory.corp.adobe.com:443/artifactory/api/npm/npm-a4u-release-local/" >> ~/.npmrc;
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Make sure the [gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) is installed globally:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Build the project, open a livereloading browser window, and watch for changes:

```
gulp dev
```

Commit changes, refercing the relevant issue number (if any):

```
git commit -m "Cool stuff, closes #250, fixes #252"
