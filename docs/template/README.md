# dna-topdoc-template
 This is a topdoc template that is used by the `spectrum-css` project to output documentation and is included as a devDependency by that project.  Topdoc can accept a template location parameter that is the package name, and it will find and use this dependency when it builds.

_***Note that this template relies on css and image resources that are not stored as a dependency here!***_ `spectrum-css` brings in those additional dependencies (from `site-resources`) and merges them at build time.
